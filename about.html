        <p>Founded in 2016, the Wolf Press is the MS447 newspaper. Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, stories will come out on this website at different times, but in most years, we publish a paper three times a year. Our aim is to present news in an honest
            way to inform the student body. Our staff meet every week, and are energetic, optimistic and full of ideas. Our staff come from everywhere throughout the school.</p><br>
        <p>A note from our 8th graders . . .</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In 2017 when we joined the Wolf Press, it was a small handful of kids. Since then, the Wolf Press has doubled in size, and now prints newspapers twice as often. We too have changed, graduating to senior writers. We look fondly back on our miniscule
            writer selves with great nostalgia. In the Fall of 6th grade, us teeny little 10 and 11-year-olds excitedly filled out our application slips and shyly turned them in. In the first meeting, we remember gazing up at the cool, confident 8th graders
            in awe and feeling professional and businesslike as we slipped on our Wolf Press staff passes. That evening, we hurried home and proudly presented our badges to our parents, showing off our new status as real Wolf Press writers. That year,
            we spent each Friday rolling around on wheely chairs and typing out stories, constantly being pestered by the editors. By seventh grade, we were the ones doing the pestering, and it felt wonderful.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As we grew comfortable in the Wolf Press community, we began enjoying meetings to the fullest extent, finding room to have fun and goof around as well as staying on top of our work. One day, we and a few friends found our teacher Ms. Willisâ€™s
            phone lying unattended near a computer. Of course, we lunged at it, excited at the opportunity to perfect our photography skills. Now, Ms. Willis has about 100 strange and distorted selfies of her favorite Wolf Press staff members on her phone.
            The Wolf Press has been a wonderful place to find friends, build our writing and leadership skills, and have a great time, and we will miss it dearly in high school next year. No newspaper experience will compare to the one we had with the
            Wolf Press, and we will use what we learned throughout high school and beyond.</p>
